            Akmal Academy with respect to the subject matter of this Agreement.
            You also may be subject to additional terms and conditions that may
            apply when you use affiliate services, third-party content or third
            party software, including but not limited to Akmal Academy terms of
            use. You may not assign your rights under this Agreement to any
            third party. If you acquired the software in any other country,
            unless expressly prohibited by local law, the TOU Agreement and
            warranties are controlled by and construed under the laws of the
            State Of Pakistan, notwithstanding any conflicts of law provisions;
            and the state and federal courts of Pakistan shall have exclusive
            jurisdiction over any claim arising under the TOU Agreement or
            warranties. You agree that this Agreement specifically disclaims the
            application of the UN Convention on Contracts for the international

            Akmal Academy may seek interim injunctive relief in any court of
            appropriate jurisdiction with respect to any alleged breach of its
            intellectual property or proprietary rights. The TOU Agreement has
            been written in the English language, and you agree that the English
            version will govern this Agreement. The failure of Akmal Academy to
            exercise or enforce any right or provision of the TOU shall not
            constitute a waiver of such right or provision. If any provision of
            the TOU is found by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid,
            you nevertheless agree that the court should endeavor to give effect
            to the parties’ intentions as reflected in the provision, and the
            other provisions of the TOU remain in full force and effect. You
            agree that regardless of any statute or law to the contrary, any
